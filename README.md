- 👋 Hi, I’m Samih!
- 👀 I have a background in cryptocurrency trading with over 2 years of experience. Currently, I'm diving into the world of coding and working through a 100 Day Python Bootcamp! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Web Foundation HTML.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on any beginner to intermediate trading-related projects built on Python. I'm excited to work with others who share an interest in the intersection of trading and technology.
